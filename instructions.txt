Todo List:
UI and/or ML Component: Tapan
Hike Database and Clustering: Liam
Trail Similarity from Input: Diego
Filter under different features to find similar trails in the database
Similar embedding space possibly 



Tech Stack:
Python (For initial feature engineering and clustering)
Geopandas
Scikit-learn 
Javascript (Frontend component)
Leaflet.JS for Google Maps overlay
GoogleMaps API for directions 



Roadmap:
Create a new database with feature-engineered features below - 
Algorithm that matches your prompt to a list of trails most similar to it
Prompt input box 

User Experience:
User describes a trail they want to travel on
Algorithm matches your prompt to a list of trails in database
Recommends N trailheads, which appear as points on the map
Pulls general data from database
Trail Difficulty (From clustering)
Trail Name
Trail Surface or Type
Trail Length
Elevation Profile 
Average 
Vehicles Allowed on Trail
Overlays geometric data from database to show
The Trail
Nearby Rivers 
Nearby Roads
Notable Elevations or Points
Contour Map
Optional:
Live Tracking on Trail shows location
Notifies you when you reach difficult sections

What we have:
Trail Name
Trail Length
Trail Type
Bicycles/other vehicles allowed
Trail Surface
What to Feature Engineer
Elevation Data (DEM)

Select intervals of the trail and sample the elevation. Then make a 1D array elevation profile graph. Get these insights out of it 
Max Slope
Average Slope
Variance of the Slope
Number of Slopes above specified threshold
Sudden changes in elevation (Points of inflection)
Concavity
Geometry (Comes from GPKG)
Length of trail (km)
Curviness of Trail (Use Sinuosity index)


Hydro Layers (Rivers, Lakes)
Minimum distance to a lake or river
# of Stream crossings (trail intersection with rivers) - find with GPKG
Proximity to Park or Natural Park
Proximity to nearest city



Historical Weather Data/Biome Data 
Average temperature year-round or per month
Average weather in area
Biome or Types of Trees
Average humidity

Trail name
Difficulty rating
